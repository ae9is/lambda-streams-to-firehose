# Lambda streams to firehose

Process DynamoDB streams data through Lambda to Firehose. This is an alternative to setting up a Kinesis Stream, which incurs per hour costs.

The code is modified from the awslabs/lambda-streams-to-firehose example: https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-streams-to-firehose
