# Lambda streams to firehose

Process DynamoDB streams data through Lambda to Firehose. This is an alternative to setting up a Kinesis Stream, which incurs per hour costs.

Based on code from [awslabs/lambda-streams-to-firehose](https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-streams-to-firehose).

Reduces scope, adds typing, and modernises.
